# IMPORTANT: Progressive Disclosure Pattern

**Use Claude Code's built-in progressive disclosure to find relevant skills efficiently:**

1. Ask Claude to identify skills related to the technologies and patterns used in this session
2. Claude will use progressive disclosure to match relevant skills without reading entire files
3. Present matched skill names to user
4. Ask which skills might need updating
5. Read ONLY the specific sections being updated (Failed Attempts, Parameters, Best Practices)
6. Never read full 400-line skill files

**Efficiency Target**: Read <200 total lines during retrospective

# Session Retrospective - Capture Your Learnings

Let me help you document what you learned during this session so you can reference it in future work.

## Step 0: Check Working Directory Status

**IMPORTANT**: Before creating a retrospective, ensure your working directory is clean.

### Check for Unstaged Changes

```bash
git status
```

**If there are unstaged or uncommitted changes:**

```
⚠️  WARNING: You have uncommitted changes in your working directory!

Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   src/some-file.ts
  modified:   lib/another-file.ts

Untracked files:
  new-feature.ts

🛑 STOP: Please commit or stash your changes before running retrospective.

Why? The retrospective will create a clean commit containing ONLY:
- Your new lesson documentation
- Updates to existing skills (if any)

Mixing this with other work makes the history unclear and harder to review.

Please do one of the following:

Option A: Commit your current work
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your work description"

Option B: Stash your changes temporarily
  git stash push -m "WIP: saving before retrospective"
  # After retrospective is done, restore with:
  # git stash pop

Then run /retrospective again.
```

**Exit retrospective - do not proceed.**

---

**If working directory is clean:**

```
✅ Working directory is clean. Proceeding with retrospective...
```

Continue to Step 1.

## Step 1: Choose Workflow

**ASK THE USER:** How would you like to save your learnings?

Use AskUserQuestion to present these options:

**Question**: "How would you like to save this lesson?"

**Options**:

1. **Direct to Main** (Recommended for solo developers)
   - Quick and simple
   - Commit directly to main branch
   - Lesson immediately available
   - No PR review needed

2. **Branch + Pull Request** (Recommended for teams)
   - Create feature branch
   - Push and create PR for review
   - Team can review before merging
   - Better for collaborative projects

**Based on their choice, proceed with the corresponding workflow in Step 5.**

## Step 2: Summarize Key Findings

**Analyzing this conversation to extract:**
- Primary goal and what you were trying to accomplish
- Approaches that worked successfully
- Failed attempts and what went wrong
- Final working solution with exact parameters
- Key insights and lessons learned

## Step 4: Identify and Update Existing Skills

**IMPORTANT**: Before committing the new lesson, analyze whether existing skills should be updated based on what you learned.

### 4.1: Identify Related Skills Using Progressive Disclosure

**Use progressive disclosure to identify skills that might benefit from this session's learnings:**

Ask Claude Code to identify skills related to:
- The technologies you worked with (e.g., CSRF, rate limiting, Clerk, Convex)
- The problem you solved (e.g., authentication, validation, error handling)
- The patterns you used (e.g., middleware, wrappers, hooks)

Claude will use progressive disclosure to match relevant skills in:
- `.claude/skills/security/*/SKILL.md` - Security implementation skills
- `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` - Other skills
- Excluding: `.claude/skills/lessons/` (those are past lessons)

**Important**: Do NOT manually Glob/Grep. Let Claude's built-in skill discovery find matches efficiently without reading full files.

### 4.2: Analyze What Should Be Updated

For each related skill, determine if you should add:

**Failed Attempts:**
- Did you discover a new way things can fail?
- Should this be added to the skill's "Failed Attempts" table?
- Example: "Tried Redis for rate limiting but too complex for this use case"

**Better Parameters:**
- Did you find more optimal values than what's documented?
- Example: Skill says "5-10 requests/min", you found 5 works best

**New Best Practices:**
- Did you discover a best practice not in the skill?
- Example: "Always set CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET in Convex dashboard, not .env.local"

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Did you hit a gotcha that's not documented?
- Example: "Webhook signature validation fails if body is parsed before validation"

**Updated Code Examples:**
- Is there a better implementation than what's shown?
- Example: More robust error handling, better TypeScript types

### 4.3: Present Proposed Updates to User

Create a summary of proposed updates:

```markdown
## 📊 Proposed Updates to Existing Skills

Based on your session learnings, the following skills should be updated:

### 1. csrf-protection/SKILL.md

**Proposed Changes:**

**Add to Failed Attempts:**
| Attempt | What We Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| X | Validating CSRF after body parsing | Signature mismatch | Always validate before parsing |

**Update Best Practices Section:**
- Add: "Validate CSRF token before any body parsing to prevent signature errors"

**Update Code Example:**
\`\`\`typescript
// BEFORE (in skill):
export const POST = withCsrf(handler);

// AFTER (your better version):
export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  // Validate CSRF before parsing
  const csrfValid = await validateCsrf(req);
  if (!csrfValid) return unauthorizedResponse();

  return withCsrf(handler)(req);
};
\`\`\`

**Reasoning:** Your session revealed that parsing body before CSRF validation causes failures.

---

### 2. rate-limiting/SKILL.md

**Proposed Changes:**

**Update Exact Parameters Section:**
- Change: "5-10 requests per minute"
- To: "5 requests per minute (optimal based on production testing)"
- Add: "Testing showed 10 req/min allowed some abuse patterns"

**Add to Lessons Learned:**
- "Start with conservative limits (5 req/min) and increase based on monitoring, not the reverse"

**Reasoning:** Your testing found specific optimal values that improve the skill's guidance.

---

Total Skills to Update: 2
Total Changes: 5

Would you like to apply these updates? (yes/no)
```

### 4.4: Get User Permission

Use AskUserQuestion:

**Question:** "Should we update existing skills based on your learnings?"

**Options:**
1. **Yes, update all** - Apply all proposed changes
2. **Let me review** - Show me each change for individual approval
3. **No, just create the lesson** - Skip updating existing skills

### 4.5: Apply Updates (If Approved)

If user approves:

**For "Yes, update all":**
- Apply all proposed changes to existing skills

- Commit message includes both new lesson AND skill updates

**For "Let me review":**
- Walk through each proposed change
- Ask yes/no for each one
- Apply approved changes
- Include in git commit

**For "No, just create the lesson":**
- Skip to Step 5 with only the new lesson

### 4.6: Update Commit Message

If skills were updated, enhance the commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add lesson: [topic-name] and update related skills

New Lesson:
- Created: .claude/skills/lessons/[topic-name]/SKILL.md

## 🔄 Feedback Loop

This retrospective process creates a **compound learning system**:

1. **New Lesson Created** → Documents your specific experience
2. **Existing Skills Updated** → Improves general best practices with real-world findings
3. **Future Sessions** → Benefit from both the lesson AND improved skills
4. **Continuous Improvement** → Skills get more accurate and comprehensive over time

**Example Impact:**
- Session 1: Discover CSRF validation order matters → Create lesson + Update csrf-protection skill
- Session 2: Someone else uses csrf-protection skill → Avoids your mistake immediately
- Session 3: You use /advise before CSRF work → Find both the lesson AND updated skill
- Result: Team knowledge compounds, mistakes aren't repeated, development accelerates

**Key Principle:** Your learnings don't just help YOU later - they improve the shared knowledge base for everyone using this system.
