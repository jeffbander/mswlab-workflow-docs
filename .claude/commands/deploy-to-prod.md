# /deploy-to-prod - Full Production Deployment

You are the production deployment assistant for Secure Vibe Coding OS. You will guide the user through a full production deployment with Clerk production keys, Convex production deployment, Google OAuth, and Stripe billing.

**Important context:** The user has already run `/install` and has a working local development setup. They may or may not have run `/deploy-to-dev` first.

**Prerequisites the user must have BEFORE running this command:**
- A custom domain they own (e.g., `myapp.com`) — Clerk production requires this, `*.vercel.app` is not accepted
- A Stripe account (for Clerk Billing integration)
- Google OAuth credentials (optional — for Google social login)

## Phase 1: Verify Prerequisites

1. Check Node.js version: `node -v` (require 18+)
2. Check if `node_modules` exists: `ls node_modules/.package-lock.json 2>/dev/null`
   - If not: run `npm install`
3. Run `node scripts/deploy.mjs check-tools`
4. Parse the JSON result and display tool status with checkmarks

5. Read `.env.local` and verify it has been configured by `/install`:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME`
   If any are missing: STOP. Display: "Run `/install` first to set up the app."

**AskUserQuestion**: "Before we begin, please confirm you have these prerequisites ready:"
- Options:
  - "Yes, I have a custom domain and Stripe account" — I'm ready to proceed
  - "I'm missing something" — I need guidance on what's required
- Header: "Prerequisites"
- multiSelect: false

**If "I'm missing something":**

Display:
```
Production deployment requires these things prepared in advance:

1. **Custom Domain** (required by Clerk)
   - Register at Namecheap, Cloudflare, Google Domains, etc.
   - You'll enter this when creating the Clerk production instance
   - *.vercel.app domains are NOT accepted by Clerk

2. **Stripe Account** (required for Clerk Billing)
   - Sign up at https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
   - Complete identity verification
   - You'll connect it to Clerk during this process

3. **Google OAuth Credentials** (optional — for Google social login)
   - Create at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   - You'll need a Client ID and Client Secret
   - Can be set up later if not ready now

Come back and run /deploy-to-prod when you have at least #1 and #2 ready.

In the meantime, you can run /deploy-to-dev to get your app on Vercel with dev keys.
```
STOP here.

## Phase 2: GitHub Setup

Check the `isUpstreamTemplate` and `gitRemote` values from check-tools.

**If `isUpstreamTemplate: true` (origin points to the template repo):**

**AskUserQuestion**: "Your git origin still points to the template repo. Would you like me to create your own private GitHub repository?"
- Options:
  - "Yes, create a private repo for me (Recommended)" — I'll create a private GitHub repo, move the template to `upstream`, and push your code
  - "No, I'll set it up myself" — I'll provide instructions for manual setup
- Header: "GitHub repo"

**If "Yes":**
- Check `gh` is installed and authenticated (from check-tools result)
- If `gh` not installed: display OS-specific install instructions, then AskUserQuestion to confirm installed
- If `gh` not authenticated: tell user to run `gh auth login`, then AskUserQuestion to confirm
- **AskUserQuestion**: "What should I name your GitHub repository?"
  - Options:
    - "[directory basename]" (Recommended) — Uses current folder name
    - "[site name from .env.local]" — Uses your configured site name
  - Header: "Repo name"
- Run: `node scripts/deploy.mjs github-setup --repo-name="<NAME>"`
- Parse result and show new repo URL

**If "No":**
Display manual instructions and AskUserQuestion to confirm when done.

**If origin is already a non-template repo:** show checkmark and proceed.

## Phase 3: Clerk Production Instance + Keys

**AskUserQuestion**: "What is your custom domain? (e.g., myapp.com or app.mydomain.com)"
- Options: "I'll enter it below" — Select 'Other' and type your domain
- Header: "Domain"

Store the domain for use in instructions.

**AskUserQuestion**: "Do you already have Clerk Production API keys (pk_live_ and sk_live_)?"
- Options:
  - "No, I need to create a production instance" — I'll walk you through the Clerk Dashboard steps
  - "Yes, I have my production keys" — You'll paste your pk_live_ and sk_live_ keys
- Header: "Clerk prod"

**If "No, I need to create":**

Display step-by-step instructions (substitute the user's domain):
```
Let's create your Clerk Production instance. Follow these steps:

1. Open Clerk Dashboard: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Select your application (the one from /install)
3. Look at the top-right — you'll see "Development" with a toggle
4. Click the toggle and select "Create production instance"
5. Choose "Clone development settings" (recommended — copies your dev config)
6. For "Application domain", enter: <THEIR_DOMAIN>
7. Click "Create Instance"

Your production instance is now created alongside your dev instance.

Now get your production API keys:
8. Make sure "Production" is selected in the top toggle
9. Go to "API Keys" in the left sidebar
10. Copy both keys — you'll paste them next
```

AskUserQuestion: "Have you created your Clerk production instance and are ready to paste your keys?"
- Options: "Yes, I have my production keys"
- Header: "Keys ready"

**Collect keys (both paths converge here):**

**AskUserQuestion**: "Paste your Clerk Production Publishable Key (starts with pk_live_). Select 'Other' and paste it."
- Options: "I'll paste it below" — Select 'Other' below and paste your pk_live_ key
- Header: "Clerk PK"

**Validate:** If doesn't start with `pk_live_`, ask again.

**AskUserQuestion**: "Paste your Clerk Production Secret Key (starts with sk_live_). Select 'Other' and paste it."
- Options: "I'll paste it below" — Select 'Other' below and paste your sk_live_ key
- Header: "Clerk SK"

**Validate:** If doesn't start with `sk_live_`, ask again.

## Phase 4: Google OAuth Setup (Optional)

**AskUserQuestion**: "Would you like to set up Google social login for production?"
- Options:
  - "Yes, walk me through it" — I'll guide you through Google OAuth setup
  - "Skip for now" — You can add Google login later from Clerk Dashboard
  - "Already configured" — I've already set up Google OAuth in Clerk production
- Header: "Google OAuth"

**If "Skip for now":** Continue to Phase 5.
**If "Already configured":** Continue to Phase 5.

**If "Yes, walk me through it":**

Display instructions:
```
Let's configure Google OAuth on your Clerk production instance.

PART A — Google Cloud Console:
1. Open: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Select your Google Cloud project (or create one)
3. If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen first:
   - User Type: External
   - Fill in app name, support email, developer email
   - Add scopes: email, profile, openid
   - Save
4. Go back to Credentials → "Create Credentials" → "OAuth Client ID"
5. Application type: "Web application"
6. Name: "Clerk Production"
7. Authorized redirect URIs: You'll get this from Clerk in the next step
   — For now, click "Create" and copy the Client ID and Client Secret

PART B — Clerk Dashboard:
8. Open Clerk Dashboard: https://dashboard.clerk.com
9. Make sure "Production" is selected (top toggle)
10. Go to "SSO Connections" → "Google"
11. Toggle "Use custom credentials"
12. You'll see the required "Authorized redirect URI" — copy it
13. Go back to Google Cloud Console → edit your OAuth client → paste the redirect URI → Save
14. Back in Clerk: paste your Google Client ID and Client Secret → Save
```

AskUserQuestion: "Have you completed the Google OAuth setup in both Google Cloud Console and Clerk?"
- Options: "Yes, it's configured" — Google OAuth is set up
- Header: "OAuth done"

## Phase 5: Stripe Billing via Clerk

Display instructions:
```
Now let's connect Stripe billing to your Clerk production instance.

1. Open Clerk Dashboard: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Make sure "Production" is selected (top toggle)
3. Go to "Billing" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Connect Stripe" and follow the Stripe onboarding
   — If prompted, log in to your Stripe account
   — Stripe will redirect back to Clerk when done
5. After connecting, create a subscription plan:
   — Clerk Dashboard → Billing → Plans → "Create Plan"
   — Set a name, monthly price, and features
   — Save the plan
6. To accept real payments:
   — Toggle from "Test Mode" to "Live Mode" in Clerk Billing settings
   — Ensure your Stripe account is fully activated (identity verification complete)
```

AskUserQuestion: "Have you connected Stripe to Clerk and created at least one plan?"
- Options:
  - "Yes, billing is configured" — Stripe is connected and I have a plan
  - "I'll set up billing later" — Skip for now, I can enable it later
- Header: "Stripe done"

## Phase 6: Convex Deploy Key

**AskUserQuestion**: "Do you already have a Convex Production Deploy Key, or should I generate one automatically?"
- Options:
  - "Generate it for me (Recommended)" — Uses your existing Convex login to create a deploy key via the API
  - "Yes, I have my deploy key" — You'll paste your prod:...|... key
- Header: "Convex key"

**If "Generate it for me":**

Run: `node scripts/deploy.mjs convex-deploy-key`

Parse JSON output:
- If `success: true`: Show the generated deploy key (masked) and production deployment name with checkmark
- If `error: "not_logged_in"` or `error: "auth_expired"`: Tell user to run `npx convex dev` to refresh, AskUserQuestion to confirm, retry
- If `error: "no_prod_deployment"`: Fall back to manual instructions for Convex Dashboard → Settings → Deploy Keys

**If "Yes, I have my deploy key":**
Collect via AskUserQuestion. Validate format (starts with `prod:`, contains `|`).

## Phase 7: Validate + Configure Clerk Production

Run: `node scripts/deploy.mjs validate-keys --clerk-pk="<PK>" --clerk-sk="<SK>" --deploy-key="<KEY>" --require-prod=true`

Parse JSON output:
- Show validation results with checkmarks
- Show derived frontend API URL
- Show JWT template status

If validation fails, display error and offer to re-enter keys.

Store the `frontendApiUrl` from the result.

## Phase 8: Deploy Convex Functions to Production

Run: `node scripts/deploy.mjs convex-deploy-functions --deploy-key="<KEY>"`

Parse JSON output:
- Show production Convex URL with checkmark
- Show production HTTP actions URL (needed for webhook)

Store `prodSiteUrl` from the result.

## Phase 9: Production Webhook + Convex Env Vars

Get admin email from `.env.local` or ask user if not found.

Run: `node scripts/deploy.mjs prod-webhook --clerk-sk="<SK>" --convex-site-url="<SITE_URL>" --admin-email="<ADMIN_EMAIL>"`

Parse JSON output and show results.

Run: `node scripts/deploy.mjs convex-prod-env --deploy-key="<KEY>" --webhook-secret="<SECRET>" --frontend-api-url="<URL>" --admin-email="<ADMIN_EMAIL>"`

Parse JSON output and show each env var set.

## Phase 10: Vercel Setup + Environment Variables

**Step 1:** Create `vercel.json` with Next.js framework preset and production build command.
The `"framework": "nextjs"` is REQUIRED — without it, `vercel project add` via CLI defaults the framework to "Other", which causes Edge Function errors with Clerk middleware.

Write `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'"
}
```

**Step 2:** Ensure code is committed and pushed.
Run `git status` — if there are changes:
- AskUserQuestion: commit and push, or handle manually
- If "Yes": `git add vercel.json && git commit -m "Add vercel.json for production builds" && git push origin main`

**Step 3:** Vercel login + link + git connect.
Derive the Vercel project name from the GitHub repo name (NOT the directory name):
1. Parse the repo name from the origin remote URL: `git remote get-url origin` → extract the repo basename (e.g., `user/my-app` → `my-app`)
2. Run: `npx vercel project add <REPO_NAME> 2>&1 || true` (creates the project on Vercel with the correct name; ignore errors if it already exists)
3. Run: `npx vercel link --yes --project=<REPO_NAME>`
If auth error: tell user to run `npx vercel login`, AskUserQuestion to confirm, retry.
4. Connect the GitHub repo for automatic deployments on push:
   Run: `npx vercel git connect --yes`
   This enables Vercel to auto-rebuild and redeploy when you `git push origin main`.
   If this fails, show warning but continue — the CLI deploy will still work. User can connect manually in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Git.

**Step 4:** Set Vercel env vars.
Run: `node scripts/deploy.mjs vercel-env --clerk-pk="<PK>" --clerk-sk="<SK>" --deploy-key="<KEY>" --frontend-api-url="<URL>" --site-name="<NAME>" --convex-url="<PROD_CONVEX_URL>"`

Use the production Convex URL from Phase 8 (`prodUrl`). This is required — server-side code (middleware, rate limiting, CSRF) needs `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` at runtime.

Parse and show each variable set.

## Phase 11: Production Deployment

Run: `node scripts/deploy.mjs vercel-deploy`

Parse JSON output:
- The result contains `url` (deployment-specific URL) and `productionUrl` (short alias like `site.vercel.app`)
- **Use `productionUrl` for display** if available, fall back to `url`
- Show the URL with checkmark
- If deploy fails, show error and retry instructions

## Phase 12: Write Summary + Completion

Build write-summary arguments from all collected data. Include google-oauth status and billing status.

Run: `node scripts/deploy.mjs write-summary --deploy-type="prod" --vercel-url="<URL>" --repo-url="<URL>" --convex-prod-url="<URL>" --convex-site-url="<URL>" --frontend-api-url="<URL>" --site-name="<NAME>" --admin-email="<EMAIL>" --google-oauth="<configured|skipped>" --webhook-url="<URL>" --completed-steps="<STEPS>" --skipped-steps="<STEPS>" --vercel-vars="<VARS>" --convex-vars="<VARS>"`

Display:

```

### Deployment Summary Saved
Full record saved to: **docs/DEPLOYMENT-PROD.md**

### Verify Your Deployment
1. Visit your production URL
2. Create a test account (Google login should work)
3. Check Convex Dashboard → Production → Data → users table
4. User should appear (confirms webhook is working)

### Remaining Setup
1. **Point your domain to Vercel**: Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Domains → Add <THEIR_DOMAIN>
2. **Configure DNS**: Add the records shown by Vercel at your domain registrar
3. **Update Clerk domain**: After DNS propagates, verify in Clerk Dashboard (Production) → Domains

### Ongoing Deployments
Future deployments happen automatically when you push to main:
  git push origin main
Vercel will auto-deploy, including Convex function updates.
```

Adjust the summary based on what actually succeeded. Note any skipped steps with guidance.
